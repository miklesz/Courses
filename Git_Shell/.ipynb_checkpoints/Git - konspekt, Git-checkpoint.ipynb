    "Dowiemy się jak skonfigurować gita oraz GitHuba, żeby nam poprawnie działały. Poznamy podstawowe słownictwo i komendy:\n",

    "* sprawdzania stanu repozytorium,\n",

    "\n",
    "Oprogramowanie do kontroli wersji pomaga kontrolować co i kiedy zrobiliśmy z danym programem lub zestawem programów. Może służyć też do zapisywania kolejnych wersji naszych plików. To zwykle jest o wiele lepsze od sytuacji z poniższego obrazka:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Kontrola wersji\n",
    "\n",
    "Kontrola wersji może służyć zapisowi kolejnych wersji dokumentów.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2019-10-24-gitbash/fig/play-changes.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "W ten sposób w każdej chwili możemy powrócić do poprzednich wersji naszej pracy i coś odzyskać lub poprawić.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nad danym dokumentem może pracować kilka osób i wtedy zwykle prowadzi to do kilku wersji tekstów\n",

    "![](https://reproducible-analysis-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/merge.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Systemy kontroli umożliwiają łatwe zarządzanie nie tylko zmianami w projekcie, ale również pozwalają zmniejszać liczbę powstających konfliktów między wersjami oraz ułatwiają rozwiązanie tych, które powstały. Są one stworzone po to by śledzić zmiany w dokumentach, decydować którą wersję w czasie konfliktu zachować tworząc nową wersję dokumentów oraz trzymają pełną historię zmian. Kompletna historia wszystkich zmian w pikach oraz wszystkich wersji plików tworzy **repozytorium**.\n",
