		Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library (both static, .lib, and dynamic, .dll versions) is compiled (C++) with MSVC 2010 on Windows XP
and uses OpenCV 2.2 (OpenCV also compiled with MSVC 2010) for image handling (Mat data structure).
It was developed for BilVideo-7 MPEG-7 compatible video indexing and retrieval system:

or valuable suggestions.

In no event and under no legal theory,      
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,      
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The library is adapted from the MPEG-7 XM Reference Software available at 
http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html

As also available in the header files adapted from the XM software, please note that:
"ISO/IEC gives users of MPEG-7 free license to this software module or
modifications thereof for use in hardware or software products claiming
conformance to MPEG-7".

The XM reference software contains some bugs and does not work properly.
Moreover, it is not meant to be used in applications directly, therefore, 
there is no decent interface to use it easily, not mentioning the horrible coding, 
which makes everybody run away at the first glance!
This library is an attempt to make the MPEG-7 feature extraction easier to integrate into new systems..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported descriptors in this library :

 + Color Structure Descriptor (CSD)
 + Scalable Color Descriptor (SCD)
 + GoF/GoP Color Descriptor (GoF/GoP)
 + Color Layout Descriptor (CLD)
 + Dominant Color Descriptor (DCD)
 + Homogeneous Texture Descriptor (HTD)
 + Edge Histogram Descriptor (EHD)
 + Face Recognition Descriptor (FRD)

Please see http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg/standards/mpeg-7/mpeg-7.htm for a brief description of each.

		How to compile your programs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory Structure:

MPEG7FexLib
	- include: header files
	- lib: contains static library MPEG7FexLib_MSVC2010.lib, MPEG7FexLib_MSVC2010.dll
	- test: sample codes with (hopefully just enough) comments illustrating the usage of the library (with CodeBlocks project file)


The library is compiled with OpenCV 2.2, which was compiled with MSVC 2010.


include directories:
	MPEG7FexLib/include
	opencv/include	

libraries:
	MPEG7FexLib: ./lib/MPEG7FexLib_MSVC2010.lib	
	OpenCV 2.2 libraries (e.g., core)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Using the API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The library has a very easy-to-use API.
You only need to include the "Feature.h" in your code and call the static member functions of the "Feature" class.
Have a look at the sample codes in the "test" directory to see how to use the library and what the output (descriptors) looks like.
The codes are commented and are (hopefully) self-explanatory.

		Similarity Computation (Matching):

For the distance metrics proposed by MPEG-7, see the MPEG-7 book:

For instance, you may use L1 distance for CSD, SCD..

Good Luck.
