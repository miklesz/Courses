Exif Reader Readme File
======================================================================

1.Introduction
------------------------->>>
Exif Reader is image file analysis software for Windows. It analyzes and
displays the shutter speed, flash condition, focal length, and other 
image information included in the Exif image format which is supported by 
almost all the latest digital cameras. Exif image files with an extension of 
JPG can be treated in the same manner as conventional JPEG files. 
This software analyzes JPEG files created by digital cameras.
Exif Reader can analyze some maker-specific formats such as Makernote.
 This software can display the image information in more details than any 
other Exif analysis software. For details, refer to the operating environment.

In addition to the Exif format, Exif Reader is applicable to the TIFF/EP format
 supported by CANON EOS D Series and Kodak digital cameras for professionals, 
the NSK-TIFF format by the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association, 
the TIFF-FX format for FAX by Xerox, and many other special image formats.
